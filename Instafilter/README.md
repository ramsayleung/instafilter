#  Instafilter

This project guided by the [100 Days OF SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/62) is tailored to apply different image effects supported by Apple Core Image framework to user-provided image.

This project leans on Core Image and SwiftUI to take full advantage of the graphics processing unit on iOS devices.

Although you can run your Core Image app in the simulator, don’t be surprised if most things are really slow – you’ll only get great performance when you run on a physical device.
